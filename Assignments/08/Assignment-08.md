# Homework  08

200 pts - 2 Parts, 100pts each.


Both parts are due the by Friday Dec 4th (officialy) but I will take the homeowrk up till the 11th of Dec.


This should be an easy project.

## Part 1 - Reading

Read the articles 

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/21/science/artificial-intelligence-fake-people-faces.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/21/science/artificial-intelligence-fake-people-faces.html)

Go to 
[https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)
and refresh the page until you generate a "bad" face - one that you can easily identify 
as a fake.  Save the known fake and turn in the image.  (Right click on the image, or on Mac - control-click, then use "Save As" or "Save Image As" to
save the file).




## Part 2 - Go and Run a Learning Program

Download and run the classification program - Train it (will take 15 mints on most laptop speed systems).

The code can be found in:
[https://github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education/F20-1015/tree/master/Lectures/24/cat-dog](https://github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education/F20-1015/tree/master/Lectures/24/cat-dog)
from Lecture 24.

Look at the file "Makefile" to see the commands to run this.  
The first target is called "train" - the line after that is how to run the training.
At the powershell prompt in the directory where you have the 2 python chunks of code, or at a shell prompt you can run this.
Or you can direct VSCode to open the directory where you have downloaded the code.  Then tell it to run the "train-model.py" first.
This will take some time to run.  Then...

The second of the targets for make is "run" - the line after that is how to run the trained model.
Tell VSCode to run the trained model.

Run a classification and dee if the results are what you expect.

Write a sentence or two on the results and why you got the results that you got. (Good or bad results).
