# Install stuff for Game - and TensorFlow

Due Nov 14

100 pts.


This is a hello world for TensorFlow and get the game from the book running.

```
$ pip install pygame
$ pip install tensorflow
```

Will do the installs.

Then verify that you have TensorFlow working using the supplied code.

Turn in a "screen capture" - of the output - check that you have version 2.3.1 of tensor flow (the version is printed out).

A demo of this is in the lecture  with the code to run.

Verify that you can get the "chapter 14" code from the book download and working.  Play a game for a few minutes.
