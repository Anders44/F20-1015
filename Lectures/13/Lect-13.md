## Why Functions are Important

1. Code re-use
2. Testability
3. Organization and Psychology
4. Readability and Documentation

Building a better "language" out on top of the existing language.
Your "new" language is the set of actions (verbs) that you can
apply to the problem at hand.


### Code Reuse

For example you want a function that performs a calculation or
set of operations.


### Testing

There are two kinds of functions - pure means that it has no
side effects.  There are languages that implement "pure" functions
an no other kind - like F# and Haskell.  If you are to build pure
functions in Python - you have to make certain that they don't
have an side effects.
