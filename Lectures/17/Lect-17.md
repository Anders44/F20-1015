Our "van" system has a heater, cooler and batteries - and we can run it.   Our next step is to take advantage of 
a little bit of free energy.  Remember that before the voltage on the solar panels is 0.4 volts higher than the
voltage on the batteries the solar charger can not charge.   On cold days we can take advantage of this early
morning ramp up.  

By adding a electric "heating" pad to the battery compartment and a new switch we can take this power
and run it through the heating pad and pre-warm the battery.
