hw3-2. Book2. 4-3. 50pts.  Counting to Twenty: Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 20,
inclusive.

Turn in your code for this.

hw3-3. 50pts.  Modify the code from 4-3 to calculate the average of the list.  Sum up the
list then divide by the length of the list.  This is the "mean" for the list.
Print this value out.

# Homework 4 (due on Sep 21) <br>

hw4-1. 50pts. Use the sample code, `read-csv.py`, and add to it a search for a name in
phone-book.csv.   This is the example from class lectures.  Save a copy of phone-book.csv
for later and copy big-book.csv over it (or rename it).  Then run the search with 
a large data set.

Turn in your code for this.

hw4-2. 50pts. Use the image, `image-of-binary-search.png` and type in the code.  Get
it to work.  Get it to work.   Do a search for a name (from the original
phone-book.csv.  Then test with the big data set.

hw4-3. 50pts.  Modify the "//" to "/" when mid is calculated.  What error do you get?

(Remember to add you name as a comment!) <br>
Turn in your code for this.

hw4-4. 50pts.  Add automated tests to the binary search code that test each case
of in the function.  (We will cover how to do this in lecture 7 - next week)
