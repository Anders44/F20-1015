## Homework 

Read the articles - and then go to 
[https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)
and refresh the page until you generate a "bad" face - one that you can easily identify 
as a fake.  Save the known fake and turn in the image.  (Right click on the image, or on Mac - control-click, then use "Save As" or "Save Image As" to
save the file).
