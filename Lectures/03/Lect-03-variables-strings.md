# Variables and Strings in Python


## Variables

Variables are different than constants.   A constant is supposed to be un-changeable, like 1, or 12 or "the".   In algebra what is called a "variable"
is often an un-changeable value.  That is what you normally think of as a "variable".  In programs it is different.  One of the nice things about Python
is that constants can't be changed.   In other languages like 'C' or 'C++' you can (usually unintentionally) change the value of constants (OUCH!!!).

In C when you add 1 + 1 and get 18 as a result that is usually a moment of anxiety.

So...

First a little diagram of what is going on - then some interactive play with python.
